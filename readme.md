#### Media Player/Manager for Chrome... in Haxe!
 
The BPlayer is written in the Haxe language and transpiled to JavaScript, which is then stuffed right into a sexy-ass Chrome packaged app.
Key features of the BPlayer are:
 - Video **and** Audio playback *(not very common among Chrome-based media players)*
 - Support for playlists, which are optionally persistent (playlists may be saved, and then restored at a later time)
 - Built-in audio visualizer
